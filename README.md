Installation
------------

Dependencies:
- Unix operating system

How to install:
- Clone fMan to anywhere you want.
- Run make 			and check for errors.
- Run make install 	and check for errors .

- [Delete blue movies you totally forgot about (JK - but srsly tho)]

Easy run
--------

Because the program is in its early stages, and I haven't made it through the first version, and I still have 'debug' folder - containing the already-compiled version of the program.

Just go to ./bin/debug/ and run ./fman and try it before you compile && install.
