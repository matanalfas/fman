Description
-----------

fMan is a very lightweight, easy-to-use file manager for *nix file systems.

Installation
------------

Dependencies:
1. Unix operating system

How to install:
1. Clone fMan to anywhere you want.
2. Run make 		and check for errors.
3. Run make install and check for errors .

[4. Delete blue movies you totally forgot about (JK - but srsly tho)]

Easy run
--------

Because the program is in its early stages, and I haven't made it through the first version,
and I still have 'debug' folder - containing the already-compiled version of the program.

You go to ./bin/debug/ and run ./fman and try it before you compile && install.
